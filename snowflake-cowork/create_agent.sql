-- ============================================================================
-- Cortex Agent: Business Insights Agent
-- ============================================================================
-- Creates an agent using the CREATE AGENT API that routes across:
--   1. Text-to-SQL (Cortex Analyst) via semantic view with verified queries
--   2. Agentic Search (multi-index Cortex Search over reviews + tickets)
--   3. Product catalog search
--
-- The agent automatically routes user questions to the right tool,
-- enabling "what happened → why" conversations that span structured
-- and unstructured data.
--
-- Prerequisites (created by setup.sql):
--   - DASH_AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE_DB.SEMANTIC.BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_SEMANTIC
--   - DASH_AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE_DB.RAW.CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_SEARCH
--   - DASH_AUTOMATED_INTELLIGENCE_DB.RAW.PRODUCT_SEARCH_SERVICE

    "orchestration": "You are a business insights assistant for an outdoor sports equipment company selling skis, snowboards, boots, and accessories. Before calling any tool, explicitly state which tool you will use and why it is the right choice for this question. TOOL ROUTING RULES: (1) query_business_data: Use for ANY question about revenue, orders, customers, segments, discounts, metrics, counts, totals, trends, or aggregations over structured data. (2) search_customer_feedback: Use for ANY question about product reviews, customer feedback, ratings, support tickets, complaints, returns, sizing issues, quality problems, or shipping issues. This searches unstructured text across reviews and tickets. (3) search_products: Use for questions about product details, features, pricing, or catalog information. (4) COMBINE TOOLS: When a user asks WHY something happened (e.g. revenue dropped), use query_business_data first to quantify the impact, then search_customer_feedback to find qualitative explanations.",
    "response": "Be concise and data-driven. Always cite specific numbers from query results. When presenting search results, include relevant context like ratings, dates, and categories.
