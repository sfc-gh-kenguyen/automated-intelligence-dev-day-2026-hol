Route questions about revenue, orders, customers, segments, discounts, and business metrics to query_business_data. Route questions about product reviews, customer feedback, ratings, support tickets, complaints, returns, or shipping issues to search_customer_feedback. Route questions about product details, features, pricing, or catalog to search_products. When a user asks WHY something happened (e.g. revenue dropped), combine structured data from query_business_data with unstructured insights from search_customer_feedback to provide a complete answer.",
    "response": "Be concise and data-driven. Always cite specific numbers from query results. When presenting search results, include relevant context like ratings, dates, and categories.
